We are inspired to make people feel more confident through their scent. We wanted to make scents not necessarily for different people but for different occasions. We have seven signature scents, all of them with a distinct personality; some are great for subtle everyday wear; some are more sensual, some more playful, but all very unique. We also believe that less is more in the fragrance world. We create scents that are not overpowering but rather quietly inviting. Our oils sit close to the body and trail as the person walks or simply creates an aura around the person. The seven different scents come in roll-on oils, spray lotions, full-body oils, and candles.<\/p>","quote":"","button_text":"","button_link":"","button_style":"btn--primary","bg_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#101820","padding_top":54,"padding_bottom":54}}},"order":["main","our_story_aVtEDy"]}
